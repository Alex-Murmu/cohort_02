// Variable   ==== variable are the naming method that helps to do stuff 
// according to what varible contains 

/// Variable are container which hold some things on it 

// There are three methods to initialize the varible 

//First  var ===> Which is now depreciated
 var container1 = "Alex";

 // var name_of_the_that_cotainer = value ;
 // lets log it 
 console.log(container1);
// let try to change the value
container1 =12;
console.log(container1)

 // Second const  ===> this will remain constant which will not changed or you can't reinitialze it while intire code

 const container2 = 13;
 console.log(container2)

//  lets try to change the value
// container2 = 13; // this will throw error
//  console.log(container2)  

// Third let == third method to initialize the variable
let container3 ="Apple";  // Also this is changable
console.log(container3);
